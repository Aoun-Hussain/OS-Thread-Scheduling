# How to access VM cluster for experiments?

**WARN: Please do not use shared VM cluster for development**

* Using GT VPN and accessing machines by ``ssh``
	- There are five of them with hostnames: ``advos-0[1-5].cc.gatech.edu``.
	- Username and password: your GT account and password.
	- Reference command: ``$ ssh gburdell3@advos-03.cc.gatech.edu`` for accessing the third machine.

* Accessing any machines as you want
	- The machines have independent storage: need to copy files across them if you try to use the other nodes.
	- Try not to crowd in certain node: using other nodes if you find too many people at current host.
		- Resource contention may let your experiments have terrible numbers.
		- Commands to check peers: ``who``, ``top`` .. etc.

* Only running program for evaluation, not for testing

* Don't leave zumbie processes and large files at machines
